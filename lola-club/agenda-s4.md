# Code Reading Club agenda

## Reflection (5 mins)
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.

### Code structure

#### Examine structure (10 mins)
The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to *do* when looking at new code for the first time. New code can be scary, doing something will help!

Color variables
* Go through the code and circle all variables in red
* Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Color method/function calls
* Go through the code and circle all methods in blue 
* Then draw a link between methods and their invocations

Instantiation 
* Go through the code and circle all instances of classes in green 
* Then draw a link between classes and their instances

#### Discuss the results (10 mins)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors?

### Content

#### Identify most important lines (10 mins)
Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important.

#### Discussion (10 mins)
Discuss in the group:

- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences individually (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences

#### Discussion (10 mins)
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly
