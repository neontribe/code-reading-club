# Code Reading Club agenda

## Reflection (5 mins)
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.

### Interaction with code (10 mins)
1. Colour1 the variables - circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses
1. Colour2 the method/ function calls - circle and draw links between declarations and calls

#### Discuss the results (10 mins)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and connections?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors and connections?

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)
1. Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important
1. Note down which line numbers people selected individually

#### Discuss (15 mins)
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences
1. Discuss in the group
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly
