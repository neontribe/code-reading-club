Central Thematic Concepts

- const list generate markup for list of patients
- load patients
- search to filter patients
-


-looks highly finctional
- bunch of functions
- whole pile of const


- component framework of react
- also own made components
- relying on whole load of other stuff
- recent react useEffect
- breaks out complicated UI
- uses REDUx


Discussion
- 3 of us picked out structural things about code being built of fuctions
- 2 peolpe talked framework - prior knowledge
- Had not seen before, not idea what does, structure
- WHy is hte code layed out this way, not guess what it does.
- noticable lack of documentation
- used method & variable names


Cebtral programming

- do not repeat yourself, highly modular
- transpolation - virtual language (react)
- type enforcement
- async procedures
- templating

- declarative - extracts the doing for you (react) e.g. virtual dom
- component driven way of buidling. expect components to have exportable blobs of markup, styles and functions

- funcitonal programming
- higher order functions
- types

-react core methods
- events
- async
- html
- html form submit
- mapping
- fetch - wait state - render
- translate key -> string
- state management in objects


Discussion
- you 3 went high level 1 went lower
- only crossover was types and componet-y nature
- backed out of code and looked for blocks that were implementing lang features
- got DRY from all the imports
- react - we know is transpiles
- async obvious
- triggered by earlier discusion on functions
- previous stuff not reading now
- looked blocks of code to identify what atterns they used on a low level
- is a .tsx file
- used types to id what htings were maybe that is why not as much docs?)


The why of the code

- React (get state management for free)
- Types 
- tsx (html really)
- Components with props to customise
- const for functions to reuse and state info
- translation system to keep copy out
- classes in html

- offline first (literally says that)
- web tool hybrid development (not native)
- included more libraries because their choice of react was was limiting (e.g. wanted types0
- most modern tecniques they could find

- Use react!
- To show patients
- No useful comments
- use spinners to make the ui seems more responsive
- reuse components, maybe not v accessible way

- functional components
- loading spinner for better UI (good idea!)


Discussion
- offline first means hybrid 
- like assigning functions to const could be less invasive to use named
- prefer named functions directly

Pros and Cons
- cons of js is library management - need to touch every month at least
- offline choice makes it hard
- where data lives? data management
- developing world aware they need to sync , not expect constant connection

Wash up:

Well
- revist used bit of code already marked
- straight into conversatoin
- made us thing more about the architechtue and concepts more
- more about planning and think about why they code is like that vs figuring out what the code does (in easrlier sessoins)
- fun

Badly
- Questioning is wide, more specific
- Why of the code needs warning that beginners might listen
- Why of the code needs more context maybe more explain
(not why they made decisions, but what they get for free and what rods they have created for backs)
- Programming concepts (for beginners prompy with 'like a for loop')

Amend resources:
- couple typos
- add 5 mins independant to why of code section
- Central theme needs more clear task
- Examine structure section same as before?
