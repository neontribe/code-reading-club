## Advanced Exercises

These exercises are more advanced, in the sense that you might need a bit more understanding of the code for these to make sense. This might be because the group is familiar with the code before the session, or because you are doing a second club on the same code snippet.

### Code structure

#### Examine structure (5 mins)

Use one of the basic exercises to examine the structure of the code (such as circle variables and link them), or reuse the notes from the previous club. Individuallt study the patterns and think about what they tell you. What direction does the code 'flow' in? What parts stand out for lack of, or access of links?

#### Discussion (10 mins)

- Parts of the code covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide 

### Content

#### Central thematic concepts (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually name the 5 most central concepts of the code. These could be names, themes, classes, or information found in comments. 

#### Discussion (10 mins)

- Topics covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

#### Central programming concepts (5 mins)

Each participant gets 5 minutes to individually name the 5 most central computer science concepts of the code. These could be algorithms, data structures, assumptions or techniques.

#### Discussion (10 mins)

- Topics covered by many vs few
- Strategies used to decide (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

### The 'why' of the code

Reexamine the code snippet and list decisions and intentions of the creator(s) of the code. For example a decision to use a certain design pattern ir use a certain library or API?

* What decisions were made in the creation of this code? 
* What assumptions do these decisions rely on?

#### Discussion (10 mins)

Gather all decisions people made individually and discuss:

- Pros of these decisions
- Possible cons of these decisions
- Alternative solutions
