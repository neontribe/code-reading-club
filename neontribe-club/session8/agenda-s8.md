# Code Reading Club agenda

## Intro 
*{7 min}*

### Set up (Facilitator, 2 min)
- Board
- Agenda

### Reflection (Group, 5 mins)
*[ 0'50 / 1'00 / 1'25 per person ]*

- Has code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations?

## Code structure
*{22 min}*

### Exercise 1: First glance (7 min)

#### Look at the code (Solo, 2 min)

Look at the code at a glance and try to answer these questions:

- What is the **first thing** that catches your eye? Why?
- What is the **second thing** that you see? Why?
- Are these two things **related** (variables, classes, programming concepts)?

#### Discuss the results (Group, 5 mins)
*[ 0'50 / 1'00 / 1'25 per person ]*

- Everyone vs a few: What lines of facts or concepts were chosen ?

- What knowledge did you use in this exercise? 


*Domain, programming language? a framework? What knowledge do you think might be needed to better understand this code?*


### Exercise 2: Examine the structure (15 mins)

#### Highlight the code (Solo, 5 min)

* Red for Varibales: Circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses

* Blue for Method/function calls: Circle and draw links between declarations and calls

* Green for Classes: Circle and draw links between classes and their instances



#### Discuss the results (Group, 10 mins) 
*[ 1'30 / 2'00 / 2'30 per person ]*

1. What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
2. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors?
3. What strategy did you use to identify the different types of element?

## Content
*{30 min}*

### Exercise 3: Most important lines (30 mins)

#### Identify the most important lines (Solo, 5 mins)

Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important.

#### Discuss the results (Group, 10 mins)
*[ 1'30 / 2'00 / 2'30 per person ]*

- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- What strategy did you use to identify importance?
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines


#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (Solo, 5 mins)

Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences

#### Discuss the results (Group, 10 mins)
*[ 1'30 / 2'00 / 2'30 per person ]*

- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (Group, 5 mins)
*[ 0'50 / 1'00 / 1'25 per person ]*

1. Create a summary together
2. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)

3. identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing

## Wash up (16 mins)

- What worked well
- What worked badly
